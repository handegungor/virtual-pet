This is the virtual pet challenge. Our pet's name is Aslan.
They can age and as they age, they get hungrier and less fit.
We can walk our pet to increase its fitness.
We can feed our pet to decrease its hunger.
We can talk to our pet to see if it needs feeding or walking.
If our pet gets hungry or unfit, it will die.
If our pet gets to 30 days old it will die.
